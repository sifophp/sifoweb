Download SIFO
=============
There are several ways to get a copy or working copy of [SIFO]. You can download a compressed file or clone the
entire project. The VCS we use at the moment is Git and we host the code in [Github] [GH].

You need at least **PHP 5.3** to run SIFO. We make use of namespaces and other capabilities of PHP only available to 5.3 and greater.



Download via tarball/ZIP
------------------------
If you don't want to mess with the version control systems, downloading a tarball or zip is the easiest way to get
the code, but upgrades to the next versions have to be done manually.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO/zipball/master" class="btn btn-success">Last version <i class="icon-circle-arrow-down icon-white"></i></a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO/tags" class="btn">Stable versions <i class="icon-folder-open icon-white"></i></a>

* Latest version is the last commit of the master branch. Commits to branch are usually controlled and safe.
* Stable versions are the ones that have run without known problems for a long time.


Clone/fork/download from github `RECOMMENDED`
--------------------------------------------
Either if you want to contribute back or not, here is the latest version of the framework, see [SIFO at Github] [GH]. We
recommend you to clone the project in your machine <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO" class="btn">Clone @ GitHub <i class="icon-refresh"></i></a> or
issue the command:

	# Clone the SIFO project into a folder called "sifo":
	git clone git://github.com/alombarte/SIFO.git sifo



Very old PHP 5.2 version (deprecated, unsupported, abandonware)
---------------------------------------------------------------
<img src="http://i0006.photobucket.com/albums/0006/findstuff22/Best%20Images/Just%20For%20Fun/802.jpg" style="height:200px; float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;border: 1px solid #ccc;"/>
This is the only version we publish prior to 2.0: the **1.9 version** and **should not be downloaded or used** in any new project.
The project was not even named Sifo, but SEOFramework.

**Target:** This version is for nostalgic people or for people who runs a tech museum.

Please be aware that **support for PHP 5.2 has been discontinued** and the framework needs a heavy migration to adapt it
to the 2.x version. Current version is very far from this old version and all the documentation online won't make any
sense to you. We fiercely discourage you to use this version:

 * Package @ Github: <https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO/zipball/sifo-1.9> `very old!! Please do not use me!`

ACHTUNG! Warning! Compte! ATENCIÓN! Do not use this version!
