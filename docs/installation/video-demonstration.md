Video tutorial

## CAUTION: THIS VIDEO IS VERY OLD AND DEMONSTRATES EARLY VERSIONS OF SIFO.


This is a quick demonstration on how to start working with Sifo: *get the code, create an instance and create the first controller* Watching a video is easier than reading a ton of documentation. It is split in two parts (that's what happens when you use demo products!)

You can also directly open the flash files in a new window:
